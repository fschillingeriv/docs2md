# Import from Myki

Use this article for help exporting data from Myki and importing into Bitwarden. Myki data exports are available as `.csv` files.

## Export from Myki

The process for exporting data from Myki is different depending on which platform you are using. Whenever possible, we recommend exporting from the Myki web app for the smoothest experience importing to Bitwarden.

For help exporting from Myki, refer to [these Myki articles](https://support.myki.com/en/articles/6007957-how-to-export-my-myki-vault).

### Condition your CSVs

**If you exported from a Myki mobile app**, you will be required to condition your `.csv` files for import into Bitwarden. This will primarily involve renaming column headers and, in some cases, re-ordering columns in the `.csv`.

Each of the following sections will document first the format exported by Myki and second the format expected by Bitwarden.

#### UserAccount.csv

```
Nickname,Url,Username,Password,Additional Info,Two Factor Secret,Status

Expected:

```

```

#### IdCard.csv

```

#### Address.csv

## Import to Bitwarden

Data can be imported to Bitwarden from the web app, browser extension, desktop app, and CLI. Data is [encrypted](https://bitwarden.com/help/what-encryption-is-used/) locally before being sent to the server for storage.

> [!NOTE] Items not imported
> While some item types cannot be imported, you can still add them to a vault:
> 
> - Upload [file attachments](https://bitwarden.com/help/attachments/) to the new vault individually.
> - Re-create [Sends](https://bitwarden.com/help/about-send/) in the new vault.

### Web app

To import data to your Bitwarden vault:

1. Select **Tools**.

3. From the **Vault** dropdown menu, select where to save the data:

 - To save data in your personal vault, select **My vault**. (Optional) Choose an existing [**Folder**](https://bitwarden.com/help/folders/) to organize the imported items.

> [!NOTE] Choosing a folder with a folder defined in the import.
> If your data file contains folders from your previous password manager and you select a destination folder from the dropdown menu, the imported folders will be nested inside the folder you selected.
 - To save data in an organization's vault, select the organization's name. (Optional) Choose a [Collection](https://bitwarden.com/help/create-collections/) to organize the imported items and share with other members. (You can only choose a collection where you have [**can manage**](https://bitwarden.com/help/about-collections/#collections-permissions/) permission.)

### Mobile

In most cases, importing data on a mobile device requires you to do so via the web app, opened in a mobile browser. You can reach this location from Password Manager by navigating to **Settings** → **Vault** → **Import items**.

On iOS 26, Bitwarden supports import using the [Fido Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP)](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-credential-exchange-specifications) for direct and easy migration of passwords, passkeys, credit cards, and personal identity information into your vault. The app you're importing from must also support CXP and steps will vary by application.

For example, on the iOS Passwords app, use the ⋯ options menu to select **Export Data to Another App** and choose Bitwarden. 

### Desktop

To import data to your vault:

1. Select **Import** from the navigation menu.
2. From the **Vault** dropdown menu, select where to save the data:

 - To save data in your personal vault, select **My vault**. (Optional) Choose an existing [**Folder**](https://bitwarden.com/help/folders/) to organize the imported items.

> [!NOTE] Choosing a folder with a folder defined in the import.
> If your data file contains folders from your previous password manager and you select a destination folder from the dropdown menu, the imported folders will be nested inside the folder you selected.
 - To save data in an organization's vault, select the organization's name. (Optional) Choose a [Collection](https://bitwarden.com/help/create-collections/) to organize the imported items and share with other members. (You can only choose a collection where you have [**can manage**](https://bitwarden.com/help/about-collections/#collections-permissions/) permission.)
3. From the **File format** dropdown menu, select the [import file format](https://bitwarden.com/help/import-faqs/#q-what-file-formats-does-bitwarden-support-for-import/).

6. After your data is imported, delete the exported data file from your computer. This will protect you in the event your computer is compromised. If you're importing to Bitwarden from another password manager or browser, you may also want to delete data from that tool.

### CLI

To import data to your vault, use the following [CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/) command:

```
bw import <format> <path>
```

`bw import` requires a format (use `bw import --formats` to retrieve a list of formats) and a path, for example:

```
bw import <format> /Users/myaccount/Documents/mydata.csv
```

After your data is imported, delete the exported data file from your computer. This will protect you in the event your computer is compromised. If you're importing to Bitwarden from another password manager or browser, you may also want to delete data from that tool.

If an “Import error” message appears, no data was added to your vault. [Fix the import file issue](https://bitwarden.com/help/import-data/#troubleshoot-import-errors/) and try again.
